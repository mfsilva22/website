I have been innovating teaching, content, and assessments in large-scale classes such as Numerical Methods, Solid Mechanics and Statics. I am very passionate about teaching and improving the classroom experience for both students and instructors. My current research focuses on the use of web-tools for collaborative activities during lectures, and on the development of online assessments for computer-based testing.  

In this website, I describe technological innovations that I have adopted in my classes or developed to help other instructors: (1) [online assessments](teaching/online_assessments/) with auto-graders, (2) bi-weekly [asynchronous tests](research/async_test/) using a computer-based testing facility, (3) [synchronized computers](research/collaborative_learning/) to enhance collaborative activities, (4) a web-app to [assign students to group projects](research/junto/), and (5) an online [drawing tool for sketches](research/drawing_tool/) that are auto-graded.

### Biography:

Mariana Silva is a Teaching Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Before joining CS@Illinois in 2017, she was a lecturer in the Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering for 5 years. She received her Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in mechanical engineering from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and earned a PhD in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from the University of Illinois in 2009. Her
doctoral research focused on the theory, computation, and design optimization of physical systems governed by partial differential equations. It addressed problems in the areas of static and transient structural topology optimization, material design, energy mitigation, fracture mechanics and robust optimization. Mariana's current educational research focuses on the exploration of technological innovations for large-scale teaching, such as the development of online course assessments.
