I am a Teaching Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Before joining CS@Illinois in 2017, I was a lecturer in the Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering for 5 years. In both departments, I have been involved in large-scale teaching innovation activities, such as the development of online course content and assessments for Statics, Solid Mechanics and Numerical Methods courses. My current research focuses on the development of online assessments for computer-based testing and the use of web-tools to facilitate collaborative programming activities during lecture. I am very passionate about teaching and improving the classroom experience for both students and instructors.

I received my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in mechanical engineering from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and earned my PhD in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from the University of Illinois in 2009. My doctoral research work focused primarily on the theoretical and computational aspects of design optimization of physical systems that are governed by partial differential equations, addressing problems in the area of static and transient structural topology optimization, material design, wave mitigation, fracture mechanics and robust optimization.
