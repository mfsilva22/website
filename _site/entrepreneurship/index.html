<p><img src="/pages/images/prairielearnlogo.png" alt="PrairieLearn logo" style="float: right; margin: 10px 10px 0px 10px; max-height: 200px; max-width: 40%;" /></p>

<p>PrairieLearn began as <a href="https://github.com/PrairieLearn">open-source software</a> in 2014, originally developed by Prof. Matt West in the Department of Mechanical Science and Engineering (MechSE) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, to enable instructors teaching Mechanics courses—initially Matt teaching Dynamics and myself teaching Solid Mechanics—to create more effective online autograded assessments for our large classes. The platform was born out of necessity, as existing commercial solutions lacked the flexibility to support sophisticated question types, offering only basic formats like multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank.</p>

<p>Over the years, word started to spread. Instructors outside the University of Illinois began using PrairieLearn, all through word-of-mouth. Early users shared how they were using the platform with their colleagues and at educational conferences, and that was enough to get more people interested.</p>

<p>Even though PrairieLearn is still open-source—meaning anyone can run it on their own infrastructure if they want—we’ve found that most instructors and university administrators would rather focus on delivering high-quality courses than dealing with the hassle of running and scaling software. To help with this, Matt West (Chief Product Officer), Nathan Sarang-Walter (Chief Technology Officer), and I (Chief Executive Officer) started <a href="https://www.prairielearn.com/about">PrairieLearn, Inc.</a> in 2021. The goal was simple: to offer a paid hosting option so that anyone can take full advantage of PrairieLearn without needing to become an expert in server administration.</p>

<h2 id="becoming-an-entrepreneur">Becoming an Entrepreneur</h2>

<p>After formally launching PrairieLearn, Inc., I participated in two NSF I-Corps programs to explore the business potential of PrairieLearn and to develop the skills needed to manage and grow a startup. As engineers without formal business experience, we saw these programs as essential for learning how to navigate the challenges of building and sustaining a successful company.</p>

<p>The Midwest I-Corps Network (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1643280&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">NSF Award #1643280</a>), hosted by the University of Michigan in Spring 2021, provided an excellent starting point. Later, in Summer 2021, I joined the National I-Corps Teams program, hosted by MIT, where we refined PrairieLearn’s value proposition and gained deeper insights into the needs of instructors and institutions (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2133470">NSF Award #2133470</a>).</p>

<p>In August 2023, PrairieLearn was awarded the prestigious NSF SBIR Phase I grant to develop an authoring environment that enables instructors without programming experience to create question generators, which allow for the accurate autograding of student-submitted content <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2304241&amp;HistoricalAwards=false">NSF Award #2304241</a>.</p>

<p>Engaging directly with academic communities has been a critical part of my entrepreneurial journey. I have delivered numerous talks and demonstrations at universities, highlighting how PrairieLearn integrates educational research to enhance computer-based assessments, support collaborative learning, and address challenges such as cheating in testing environments.</p>

<p>Academic conferences have also been a key venue for showcasing PrairieLearn. We made our first exhibitor appearance at <a href="https://www.asee.org/events/Conferences-and-Meetings/2025-Annual-Conference/Sponsors-Exhibitors/Exhibitor-List-(2)">ASEE</a> in 2023, an event we have continued to attend annually. In 2024, we exhibited at SIGCSE for the first time, and hosted an Affiliated Event to <a href="https://sigcse2024.sigcse.org/details/sigcse-ts-2024-affiliated-events/10/Spiffy-STAR-Assessments-With-PrairieLearn-Skill-specific-Tagged-to-competencies-Au">showcase Spiffy Assessments</a> within PrairieLearn. That same year, we hosted a demo table at <a href="https://www.asugsvsummit.com">ASU+GSV</a>. By 2025, we will take a significant step forward by becoming a <a href="https://sigcse2025.sigcse.org">SIGCSE sponsor</a>.</p>

<p>Through these efforts, PrairieLearn has grown into a trusted tool adopted by universities across the United States, Canada, and Brazil, impacting thousands of students and educators. My journey as an entrepreneur has been deeply rewarding, offering opportunities to innovate, collaborate, and shape the future of education technology.</p>
