            <p>My research work is often motivated by the challenges I encounter when I teach. They provoke my curiosity to understand how students learn, how I can enhance their learning motivation, and how I can improve my learning goals and assessments. My research interests have been focused in three areas: (a) improvement of assessment tools, (b) development of collaborative learning activities to promote student’s interaction, and (c) innovation and improvement of courses via communities of practice.</p>

<h2 id="a-assessment-tools">A) Assessment tools</h2>

<h5 id="improving-assessments-with-frequent-testing-and-second-chance-exams"><a href="/research/frequent_testing/">Improving assessments with frequent testing and second-chance exams</a></h5>

<p>To study the effect of summative and formative assessments, I replaced the “traditional” two midterm exams with seven bi-weekly online quizzes in Fall 2015, but kept the same final exam. Scores from the final exam indicated that students who completed seven short assessments over the course of the semester scored higher on the final exam than students who completed two longer mid-term examinations, and they were twice as likely to receive a perfect score on the multiple-choice section of the exam.</p>

<h5 id="investigating-the-effect-of-cheating-during-computer-based-testing"><a href="/research/async_test/">Investigating the effect of cheating during computer-based testing</a></h5>

<p>A controlled crossover experiment compared student’s scores when quizzes were taken following an asynchronous schedule (over a period of four days) and synchronously during lecture time.
The results indicated that students taking the exams asynchronously had scores that were on average approximately 3% higher. This study also indicated that question randomization reduces the score advantage.</p>

<h5 id="a-drawing-based-tool-for-online-assessments"><a href="/research/drawing_tool/">A drawing-based tool for online assessments</a></h5>

<p>A few years ago, I developed an interactive drawing question framework using JavaScript and HTML5 canvas in the browser, which allows students to interactively draw diagrams, such as free-body diagrams in Mechanics classes,  which are auto-graded and provide immediate feedback. More recently, I worked with an undergraduate student to upgrade the drawing tool using a simple HTML markup language.</p>

<h2 id="b-collaborative-learning-activities">B) Collaborative Learning Activities</h2>

<h5 id="development-of-collaborative-learning-activities-in-large-classes"><a href="/research/collaborative_learning/">Development of collaborative learning activities in large classes</a></h5>

<p>One great way of learning is by teaching. Collaborative learning activities provide the space for students to construct their own knowledge, while helping other students simultaneously.  In addition, it is much easier to focus on a given activity for the duration of a class when you are actively thinking, instead of just “listening”. I have created many collaborative learning activities for the courses I teach, both for the smaller discussion sections, and also for the large size lectures. The learning goals for these classes do not only include understanding of technical content, but also practice of soft-skills such as collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking.</p>

<h5 id="using-a-performance-prediction-model-and-collaborative-learning-activities-to-provide-additional-support-to-students-"><a href="/research/intervention/">Using a performance prediction model and collaborative learning activities to provide additional support to students </a></h5>
<p>One of the challenges of teaching large upper-division undergraduate classes with multiple prerequisites is figuring out how much we can assume as prior knowledge, and what we should include as review. For example, I have observed that disparity in programming skills can greatly affect the overall student’s experience in the classroom and potentially their overall course performance. In order to provide extra resources to students that come less prepared to the class, I have trained a model using machine learning algorithms to predict students that are at risk of lower performance, based on data from previous semesters. This prediction uses assessments given during the first two weeks of classes, enabling me to provide very early feedback to students.</p>

<h2 id="c-working-with-other-faculty-to-improve-teaching-and-learning">C) Working with other faculty to improve teaching and learning</h2>

<h5 id="-innovation-and-improvement-of-courses-via-community-of-practices-"><a href="/research/CoP/"> Innovation and improvement of courses via community of practices </a></h5>

<h5 id="-development-of-a-web-tool-to-build-project-teams-based-on-students-preferences-"><a href="/research/junto/"> Development of a web-tool to build project teams based on student’s preferences </a></h5>

<p>In 2014 I developed a program based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) to help instructors teaching design classes assigning students to sponsored projects. This software has been adopted successfully used by three instructors, helping more than 1000 students, increasing the overall student satisfaction in the class, and reducing the number of hours spent by the instructor creating the teams (from 1-2 days to a couple of hours).</p>
