            <p>I believe the teaching process should involve continual improvement of the course, based on research and data-driven analytics. In this regard, I have continually tracked how the implemented teaching innovations impacted the students, by asking them to complete standardized surveys (Informal Early Feedback) every semester and tracking performance on standardized assessments. For example, prior to the creation of the active learning classroom, I asked students to give their opinion regarding the space available for discussion sections. In the following semester, students responded to the same survey after they had utilized the new classroom for a couple of months. The results indicated that the remodeling promoted better collaboration among students during class. I have monitored student learning gains when changing course assessment, such as changing from midterm exam to bi-weekly quizzes, by using the same final exam to compare performance of both classes.</p>

<!-- According to surveys that I give to students during the semester, students prefer online homework with unlimited attempts, and feel they learn concepts better than the more traditional hand-written homework.

 Among other things, I am able to track through surveys student’s perception of the course material, how much time they spend preparing for the class, the effectiveness of my course staff, and the use of technology in classrooms. Using such measured data allows me to continually improve the overall class experience for both students and instructors. -->
