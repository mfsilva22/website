## Teaching philosophy

I have taught eight different undergraduate courses with over 4700 students, from freshman to senior level. Throughout my teaching I observed and improved how: (a) students learn better when they construct their knowledge through active learning, (b) students are more engaged when applying class concepts to solve real-world problems, and (c) the learning process and knowledge retention are improved with the use of frequent assessments and immediate feedback.

 <!-- I have taught eight different undergraduate courses with over 4700 students, varying from freshman to senior level classes. Through all of these teaching experiences, I have developed a teaching philosophy centered on three principles: (a) students learn better when they are able to construct their own knowledge through active learning,
 (b) students are more engaged when applying concepts from class to solve real-world problems, and (c) the learning process and knowledge retention can be improved with the use of frequent assessments with immediate feedback -->
