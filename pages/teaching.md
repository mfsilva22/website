### Teaching practices

##### Lecture content
 I prepare “pre-lecture” notes that I give to students prior to the lecture, which essentially include topics, main bullet points, example problem statements, figures and plots. In class, I use a tablet computer to complete the missing information, which mostly include the solution of examples. The annotations are saved and given to students as “post-lecture” notes. Lectures are also recorded and made available to students.

##### Interactive lecture
During lecture-style classes, students are not required to copy the projected annotations, since they know I will make the content available after the class, which encourages more participation during lecture. The interaction with students is enhanced through the use of short quiz questions. Students are encouraged to talk to their peers to construct their answer. I sometimes use questions that are geared toward common mistakes seen in previous semesters, helping students avoid these common pitfalls.

##### Collaborative problem-solving activities
At 

##### Computational thinking

##### Homework for mastery of skills

##### Frequent testing

##### Evaluation of innovations
