header:  Drawing questions implemented via PrairieLearn

### Example 1:

This is a simple example of the PrairieLearn drawing tool used to sketch mathematical functions (read more about the development of this tool [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/research/PLdrawing.md %})).

<figure class="figure border m-3">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"> Figure 1: example of a sketching question using the PrairieLearn drawing tool.</figcaption>
 </figure>

To complete this sketch, students can use two different objects: straight lines (object (1) in Fig. 2) and quadratic curves (object (2) in Fig. 2). Students can move the objects by moving the position of the *control points* (marked with purple squares in Fig. 2)). The shape of the quadratic curve is modified by moving the third (middle) control point.

     <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/images/drawing_graph_explanation.png" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-bottom:20px; max-height: 400px; max-width: 90%;  clear:">
  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"> Figure 2: Users can insert straight lines and quadratic curves. Objects are placed at their correct position by moving the control points, marked with purple squares. The quadratic curve has its shaped modified according to the location of the third (middle) control point. </figcaption>
   </figure>

The total points for each question is distributed equally among the expected objects for the correct answer. In this example, each object accounts for 1/3 of the points for the question. Figure 3 illustrates one submission where the student gets only one of the objects marked as correct. In this question, no feedback is provided.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"> Figure 3: on the left is an example of submission with partial credit, and on the right is an example of a perfect submission.</figcaption>
  </figure>

### Example 2:

This is an example that illustrates some of the typical objects that appear questions from Mechanics courses.
In the example below, students are expected to place one of the following: points, force vectors, moments,  uniform or triangular distributed loads.

<figure class="figure border m-3">
   <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/images/place_objects_intro.png" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-bottom:20px; max-height: 320px; max-width: 90%;  clear:">
 <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"> Figure 4: Illustration of typical objects that appear in Mechanics courses: points, force vectors, moments, uniform or triangular distributed loads.</figcaption>
 </figure>

 Figure 5 illustrates how objects can be modified to achieve a desirable outcome. For example, in order to get a distributed load in the range from B to C that points upwards, one should stretch and rotate the object, using the handles as indicated  in Fig. 5.

<figure class="figure border m-3">
   <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/images/place_objects_explanation.png" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-bottom:20px; max-height: 380px; max-width: 90%;  clear:">
 <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"> Figure 5: Using the handles to modify the dimension and rotation of the object. The object is also moved (dragged) to the correct location.</figcaption>
 </figure>

 In this example question, students will get a randomized variant of the question. Some will be asked to find a position with respect to the coordinate system, or place a force vector with given orientation and location, or place a moment. Figure 6 illustrates three different variants of the same question.

<figure class="figure border m-3">
   <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/images/3_examples_pl_drawing.png" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; padding-bottom:20px; max-height: 500px; max-width: 90%;  clear:">
 <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center"> Figure 6: different variants of the same question, showing the correct answer.</figcaption>
 </figure>
