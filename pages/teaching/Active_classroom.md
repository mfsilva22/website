header:  Creating an active learning classroom
---

In the initial implementations of collaborative learning activities, the discussion sections were assigned to traditional classrooms, typically with slanted, arm-chairs, where students had to move around to form groups of 3 or 4 members. Based on student feedback, we learned that the classrooms were too crowded and the desks themselves did not facilitate group collaboration. Moreover, the discussion sections met at different locations around campus, making it cumbersome, and sometimes impossible, to implement activities that required the use of equipment for the hands-on learning. In Summer 2015, I was able to obtain funds from the College of Engineering to remodel a classroom, and purchase new furniture that allowed collaborative learning and traditional lecture configurations. The classroom was designated as the Mechanics Studio, used by students taking Statics, Solid Mechanics and Dynamics courses.

 Future surveys reported students no longer felt the space was over-crowded and felt it was much easier to work collaboratively.
