header:  Programming assignments with real-world applications
---

In a Fall 2018 survey, many students reported that they would like to have more discussion of applications during lecture, as illustrated in the figure below. They also indicated that they would like less derivation of mathematical expressions.

</tr>

Based on this feedback, I created additional IPython notebooks for lecture demos and started giving Machine Problems (MPs) as homework assignments, all addressing real-world applications of numerical methods. Based on surveys in Spring 2019, students indicated that the MP assignments covered interesting topics and helped them understanding the course content.
