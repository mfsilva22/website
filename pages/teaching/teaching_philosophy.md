Before coming to the University of Illinois to pursue a PhD, my interest in teaching was sparked through my early involvement with high school tutoring and teaching handball and Brazilian martial arts to younger students. At the University of Illinois, while getting my PhD, I was a teaching assistant for five semesters, and since Spring 2012, I have taught eight different undergraduate courses with over 4700 students, varying from freshman to senior level classes. Through all of these teaching experiences, I have solidified my interest in not being just a good instructor, but the best possible instructor I could be, and have developed a teaching philosophy centered on three principles: (a) students learn better when they are able to construct their own knowledge through active learning, (b) students are more engaged in the learning experience when they can apply the concepts they learn in classes to solve real-world problems, (c) the learning experience and knowledge retention can be improved with the use for frequent summative assessments with immediate feedback.

Research has shown that students learn better when they participate in the process of learning, which does not occur during “traditional” lectures where instructors deliver the information and students are expected to sit and listen. To help students learn the course material, I have incorporated active learning opportunities in many components of the classes I teach: (1) In order to encourage students' participation in class, I give students access to pre-lecture notes prior to each lecture. Since students are not focused solely on copying material from the board or screen, they are more likely to engage in class discussions. The interaction with students is enhanced through the use of short quiz questions, where students are encouraged to talk to their peers to construct their answer. (2) I use collaborative learning activities in different parts of my lectures. For example, I developed guided Ipython notebooks to be used during flipped lectures, and students are encouraged to complete these notebooks in groups. (3) I have adopted online homework format, where students have unlimited attempts and immediate feedback. By doing so, students have the opportunity to construct their own knowledge as they work on their homework by figuring out their own mistakes. When students receive feedback about an assignment the week after its completion, they are unlikely to go back to the previous work and try to understand where they made mistakes. This drawback is eliminated when students have access to immediate feedback and the opportunity to re-try questions they get incorrect.


and now about online homework


To improve student engagement and enthusiasm in the classroom, I believe it is important to make course content relevant and relatable to contemporary and real-world problems.


In the last four years as an instructor, I have come to realize it takes constant commitment to inspire students and support their growth on an academic and personal level. I care about students, and strive to be a role model willing to invest the time and effort in order to help students succeed. Teaching is so much more than transmitting information from a book to the students, it is to encourage and inspire them to effectively use their minds and engage their passions to solve real world problems.
