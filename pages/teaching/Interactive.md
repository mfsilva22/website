One great way of learning is by teaching. Collaborative learning activities provide the space for students to construct their own knowledge, while helping other students simultaneously.  In addition, it is much easier to focus on a given activity for the duration of a class when you are actively thinking, instead of just "listening". I have created many collaborative learning activities for the courses I teach, both for the smaller discussion sections, and also for the large size lectures. The learning goals for these classes do not only include understanding of technical content, but also practice of soft-skills such as collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking.


### Transforming traditional lecture-style sections into collaborative learning activities

Large freshman and sophomore classes are usually linked to smaller discussion sections, where students have the opportunity to work on problem solving skills. Historically, teaching assistants (TA) assigned to discussion sections were expected to solve a set of given problems on the blackboard, while students copied the solution. According to feedback, students did not get much out of the discussion sections, and therefore attendance was low. In Fall 2013, I overhauled the discussion sections for an Introductory Solid Mechanics course, creating group collaborative activities where students solved real-world engineering problems, open-ended design problems, and/or hands-on activities. In the initial implementations of these collaborative learning activities, the discussion sections were assigned to traditional classrooms, typically with slanted, tablet chairs, where students had to move the chairs around to form groups of three or four members. Based on student feedback, we learned that the classrooms were too crowded and the desks themselves did not facilitate group collaboration. Moreover, the discussion sections met at different locations around campus, making it cumbersome, and sometimes impossible, to implement activities that required the use of equipment for the hands-on learning. In Summer 2015, I was able to obtain funds from the College of Engineering to remodel a classroom, and purchase new furniture that allowed collaborative learning and traditional lecture configurations. The classroom was designated as the Mechanics Studio, used by students taking Statics, Solid Mechanics and Dynamics. Future surveys reported students no longer felt the space was over-crowded and felt it was much easier to work collaboratively.


Interactive lectures to promote student’s participation

I prepare pre-lecture notes that I give to students prior to the lecture, which essentially include topics, main bullet points and examples. In class, I use a tablet computer to complete the missing information, which mostly include the solution of examples. The annotations are saved and given to students as post-lecture notes. Lectures are also recorded and made available to students.  

During lecture-style classes, students don’t feel required to copy the projected annotations, since they know I will make the content available after the class, which encourages more participation during lecture. The interaction with students is enhanced through the use of short quiz questions. Students are encouraged to talk to their peers to construct their answer. I sometimes use questions that are geared towards common mistakes seen in previous semesters, helping students avoid these common pitfalls.

Some of my lectures follow a flipped-classroom style, where students work on programming activities using Jupyter notebooks, either in collaboration or individually. Each activity brings a real-world example where they need to apply concepts covered in the previous lectures. These activities follow a guided-structure such that students have the ability to complete the assignment on their own, but they can also get help from their peers, from one of the teaching assistants in the classroom, or from me.



### Lecture content

 I prepare “pre-lecture” notes that I give to students prior to the lecture, which essentially include topics, main bullet points, example problem statements, figures and plots. In class, I use a tablet computer to complete the missing information, which mostly include the solution of examples. The annotations are saved and given to students as “post-lecture” notes. Lectures are also recorded and made available to students.

### Implementing collaborative learning activities in programming classes

In order to get students to have bigger participation during my lectures, this semester I changed one third of my classes from lecture-style format to active learning. For these classes, students work on guided real applications, given in the form of a Jupyter notebook. The programming knowledge needed to complete the assignment is basic, however, students can highly benefit from the exchange of ideas in order to come up with better strategies and solutions. The learning goals of these classes do not only include understanding of technical content, but also practice of soft-skills such as collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking. Unfortunately, fostering a collaborative learning environment in a class with 200 students is very challenging: many students would prefer to work on their own, the physical space of a lecture hall is not ideal to encourage collaboration, and I cannot assist all the students or groups to make sure the class is making progress as a whole (and I do have 3 teaching assistants in the classroom with me). Searching for solutions, I started experimenting using CoCalc (a web-tool for collaborative calculations) in a smaller class with 40 students, where they are split in 6 groups. After only two classes, we have noticed an increase in the collaborations. Unfortunately, CoCalc is expensive, and still presents some syncing issues.  In future semesters, I plan to explore the development of an open-source collaborative tool for programming assignments that can be used in large lectures, in which students are assigned to virtual rooms where they work collaboratively on the same project.
