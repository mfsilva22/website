## Research Statement

My research work is often motivated by the challenges I encounter when I teach. They provoke my curiosity to understand how students learn, how I can enhance their learning motivation, and how I can improve my learning goals and assessments. My research interests have been focused in three areas: (a) improvement of assessment tools, (b) development of collaborative learning activities to promote student's interaction, and (c) innovation and improvement of courses via communities of practice.

## A) Assessment tools

- [Improving assessments with frequent testing and second-chance exams]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/research/TAM_frequent_test.md %})

- [A drawing-based tool for online assessments]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/research/PLdrawing.md %})


## B) Collaborative Learning Activities

- [Using software to encourage collaboration]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/research/Collaborative_Learning_Large_Classes.md %})


## C) Working with other faculty to improve teaching and learning

- [ Innovation and improvement of courses via community of practices ]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/research/CoP.md %})

- [ Development of a web-tool to build project teams based on studentâ€™s preferences ]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/research/Junto.md %})
