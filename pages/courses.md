#### Brushing up linear algebra and programming fundamentals using Python (CS 199)
In this class, students will review fundamentals of linear algebra and programming using python. Students will work in teams to create and/or complete jupyter notebooks, some of them addressing real world scenarios.
[Fall 2019]

<a name="cs199py"></a>
#### Python for Data (CS 199)
Introduces concepts for obtaining, analyzing, visualizing, and processing data from various sources. Covers image processing and feature identification, streaming data sources, text scraping, and basic elements of data analysis and machine learning.
[Fall 2019]

<a name="cs199ap"></a>
#### Real World Cases in Scientific Computing (CS 199)
Numerical methods in scientific and engineering applications. Students need to be co-registered in the Numerical Analysis course (CS 357). In this class, students will work in teams brainstorming the solution and setup of real world applications of numerical methods in scientific and engineering problems. These activities will be offered through guided worksheets, in which students will have the opportunity to develop and improve skills such as problem solving, effective teamwork and critical thinking.
[Fall 2018]

<a name="cs498onl"></a>
#### Introduction to Online Learning Systems (CS 498)
In this project-based course, students will learn about online learning systems as they develop questions and tools for an existing online learning platform. Students will learn core educational theories about how to make effective online learning systems including perspectives from statistics, cognitive science, and motivational research.
[Fall 2017]

<a name="me471"></a>
#### Finite Element Analysis (ME 471)
The finite element method and its application to engineering problems: truss and frame structures, heat conduction, and linear elasticity; use of application software; overview of advanced topics such as structural dynamics, fluid flow, and nonlinear structural analysis.
[[Spring 2016](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/me471/sp2016/), [Spring 2017](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/me471/sp2017/)]


<a name="tam251"></a>
#### Introductory Solid Mechanics (TAM 251)
Relationship between internal stresses and deformations produced by external forces acting on deformable bodies, and design principles based on mechanics of solids: normal stresses, shear stresses, and deformations produced by tensile, compressive, torsional, and bending loading of members; beam deflections; elastic energy and impact; multi-dimensional stress states; buckling of columns.

<a name="tam210"></a>
#### Statics (TAM 210/TAM211)
This course covers fundamental concepts in mechanics, such as forces, moments, free-body diagrams, structural analyses of frames, trusses, and machines, shear-force and bending-moment diagrams, Coulomb friction, centroids, center of mass and moment of inertia. By the end of the semester, students are able to solve rigid body mechanics problems that will inform the design in many applications, such as bridges and biomedical devices.
