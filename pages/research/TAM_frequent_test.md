header: Improving assessments with frequent testing and second-chance exams
---


Research in engineering education shows that frequent assessments help with long-term retention of course content. Moreover, by giving students instant feedback during these assessments, they have the opportunity to promptly identify their strengths and weaknesses, seek help, or change their study strategies for following assessments. To study the effect of summative and formative assessments, I replaced the “traditional” two midterm exams with seven bi-weekly online quizzes in Fall 2015, but kept the same final exam. The online quizzes were offered at a computer-based testing facility (CBTF) where students had immediate feedback of their performance. In addition, students were also offered an optional retry quiz, to improve their grade on the first attempt. Scores from the final exam indicated that students who completed seven short assessments over the course of the semester scored higher on the final exam than students who completed two longer mid-term examinations, and they were twice as likely to receive a perfect score on the multiple-choice section of the exam. These results match research data from other fields, which shows that shorter and more frequent assessment opportunities are beneficial for student learning and long-term retention of the material.
