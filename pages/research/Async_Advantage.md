header: Investigating the effect of cheating during computer-based testing
---

In Spring 2019, I performed a controlled crossover experiment designed to measure the score advantage that students have when taking the quizzes asynchronously at a computer-based testing facility (i.e., students could select a time to take the exam in a period of 4 days) compared to synchronous quizzes (when all students took the quiz during lecture time). Students were split into two groups using stratified sampling, and they alternated taking the quizzes in the asynchronous and synchronous formats. These non-programming exams consisted of a mix of multiple choice, checkbox, and numeric input questions. For some questions, the parameters were randomized so that students received different versions of the question and some questions were identical for all students. The results indicated that students taking the exams asynchronously had scores that were on average approximately 3% higher. Furthermore, the score advantage didn’t significantly differ based on the type of the question, but the use of randomization mitigated but did not completely eliminate the score advantage, which is consistent with available research.

A survey collected at the end of the semester indicated that students highly prefer taking asynchronous exams, and they don’t feel that cheating is a big problem at CBTF, or that the assessment system is unfair to students that comply with academic integrity rules.
