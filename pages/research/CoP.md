header:  Innovation and improvement of courses via community of practices

[Under construction]

<!--
And as students learn better through active learning and collaborative activities, I believe we instructors also become better educators when working within a supportive community of people who care about teaching and are actively trying to find innovative ways of enhancing the classroom experience. It is through a community that ideas on class improvements are exchanged and enriched by the diverse experiences, backgrounds and perspectives of the members. I have been fortunate to belong to talented groups of both faculty and students.

As I worked on the development and implementation of course improvements in the Mechanics courses,
it was important to develop a community of practice (CoP) consisting of faculty who were committed to continuing these reforms and able to collaborate closely. Instructors that belonged to this CoP had weekly meetings to discuss course development, teaching assistant training and assessments tools. Within this community, I developed lecture content and a large data set of online assessments for the Solid Mechanics and Statics courses. I have also mentored and assisted other faculty when teaching these large classes for the first time.

Starting in Spring 2020, a team of faculty from Mathematics, Computer Science and Mechanical Engineering Departments will start a project to improve the curriculum of the Linear Algebra course offered to students at the College of Engineering. The plan is to make the class more suitable to sophomores, by removing Calculus III prerequisite requirements, and add computational tools so that students can solve more complex and realistic examples. I will be creating the computer lab assignments for this class, which will be implemented as collaborative learning activities during small discussion sections. We will pilot these new activities in Spring 2020 to a subset of only 30 students, and the goal is to change the format of the discussion sections for the entire class (1000 students) in Fall 2020.

### Extending the impact of the use of PraireLearn at Illinois and other Universities

As many programs are facing a surge in admissions, lectures are becoming larger and instructors are more frequently adopting some type of automation to manage this growth.


PrairieLearn (PL) is a framework for online learning that was built at Illinois. The âGrowing PLâ team plans to grow the community of instructors who use and think critically about PL, in order to extend its positive impact across the Campus. I started using PL in 2015, becoming the second user of this online learning system. In Fall 2019 semester, 51 different courses are using PL as an assessment tool, with more than 8,000 distinct students as users.  For the last 4 years, I have helped many instructors and teaching assistants to create their courses and first few questions, by offering group workshops and individualized support. As part of this community of practice, I help staffing the PL office hours that we offer weekly and also make contributions to the system development.
