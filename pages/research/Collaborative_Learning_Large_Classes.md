### Collaborative software for hand-written solutions

 Collaborative learning activities provide the opportunity for students to construct their own knowledge, while helping other students simultaneously. After converting the discussion sections of two of my Mechanical Engineering classes from traditional lecture-style to collaborative learning activities, I noticed that interactions among students were substantially improved when I replaced the old arm chairs with active learning furniture. However, some students were still working on their own printed worksheet without communicating with the rest of the group, despite of the physical arrangement.

 To further improve the collaboration among students, I started working with faculty from the College of Education on a project to develop a web-based application that supports the joint construction of problem solutions in a shared browser environment. During discussion sections, students have to work on the collaborative activity using tablet computers (instead of printed worksheets) that are synced among members of the same group, promoting more interactions between students.
 During the first years of this project, the research team collected log data from the tablets, and videos and audios from the classes. Data-driven models were developed to predict common interaction behaviors among students, such as “off-task”. We used these predictions to provide prompts to instructors in real-time during class, providing them guidance during the collaborative learning activities. This web-based application only allows for hand-written solutions using tablets.

 <!-- Thus, as an extension of this project, we are in the initial stages of developing an open-source web-based solution similar to [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/help?session=default) (a paid collaborative tool) where a group of students complete programming assignments on a shared project. -->

### Computer-based collaborative tool with auto-grading and immediate feedback

Most of the evidence-based practices for collaborative
learning rely on the assumption of face-to-face interactions or asynchronous online activities. This research proposes to develop robust tools and pedagogies for online synchronous computer-supported collaborative
learning activities.

In Fall 2020, we added collaborative features to our open-source online assessment system [PrairieLearn](https://www.prairielearn.com) to allow students to share the same assessment content and grades. We are currently adding the ability for groups to self-assign structured roles (e.g. [POGIL](https://pogil.org)), and developing a dashboard with the aim a) to help instructors track group's progress and collaborative patterns and b) to bring more awareness to the teams during the learning process.

In our first study, we investigated the trade-offs between asynchronous (student-scheduled) and
synchronous (instructor-scheduled) collaborative learning. We performed a
quasi-experimental study in two courses — Computer Architecture and Numerical Methods — to
compare the effects of asynchronous collaborative learning without structured roles to
synchronous collaborative learning with structured roles. We use a data-analytics approach to
examine how these approaches affected the student learning experience during formative
collaborative learning assessments. Teams in the synchronous offering made higher scoring
submissions (5-10% points better on average), finished assessments more efficiently (11-16
minutes faster on average), and had greater equality in the total number of submissions each
student made (for example, significant increase of 13% in the mean equality score among all
groups).
